    <h1>Life: An FAQ</h1>
    <button class="accordion">What’s the meaning of life?</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>This is the wrong question to ask. It’s like asking “what’s the meaning of water?” So there’s no meaning to life, because life can’t have a meaning. But you can live a meaningful life. What meaning you give your life is not only up to you, it’s what you have to live with.</p>

    <button class="accordion">What’s the best philosophy for life?</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>The best philosophy for life is your own philosophy for life. Take inspiration from others, but make your own way for yourself, don’t mindlessly follow a pack. </p>
      </div>
    <button class="accordion">Is there a perfect way to approach life?</button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p> No. People are not machines. Life is an art, not a science. </p>
